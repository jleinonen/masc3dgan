3D reconstruction of snowflakes from multi-angle images with a GAN (3D-GAN)

This code implements the code from the paper "Mass and geometry reconstruction of snowfall particles from multi angle snowflake camera (MASC) images".

The folder 'examples/' provide a brief script with practical instructions on how to run 3D-GAN to generate its output. A small dataset, also used in the reference paper, is stored under 'data/'
